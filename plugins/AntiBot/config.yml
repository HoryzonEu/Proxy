### Condition System ###
#
# PPS means Pings/second (Connections that pinged the server in the last second)
# CPS means Connections/second (Connections that are trying to connect in the last second)
# JPS means Joins/second (Connections that fully joined the server in the last second)
#
# When the conditions are true the module will start working.
# If the conditions are false, the module won't check anyone.
# This is made so we can save performance when there is no attack.
#
# Setting all conditions to 0 keeps the module always active.
